Telecom Customer Churn Prediction
Business Context
In the telecom industry, customer retention is crucial due to the high cost of acquiring new users compared to retaining existing ones. With an annual churn rate ranging from 15% to 25%, telecom providers face significant revenue losses when customers switch to competitors. Given that retaining a customer is often 5-10 times more cost-effective than acquiring a new one, minimizing churn is a top priority.

For telecom operators, especially in competitive markets like India and Southeast Asia, reducing churn among high-value customers is critical. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify users at risk of churn, enabling proactive intervention.

Defining Churn in the Telecom Industry
Telecom companies operate under two primary payment models:

Postpaid: Customers pay after using services, and churn is directly observed when they request service termination.
Prepaid: Customers recharge in advance, and churn is not explicitly communicated, making it challenging to distinguish between temporary inactivity and permanent churn.
Since prepaid is the dominant model in India and Southeast Asia, accurately defining churn is essential. Two common approaches include:

Revenue-based churn: Users who do not generate revenue over a period. However, this may misclassify users who receive incoming calls but do not make outgoing calls or use data.
Usage-based churn: Users who have not engaged in any telecom activity (calls, SMS, or data usage) within a given timeframe. This approach ensures that only completely inactive users are considered churners.
For this project, churn is defined based on the usage-based approach.

High-Value Customer Churn
Since a small percentage of customers contribute to the majority of revenue, the focus is on high-value customers (HVCs). These are identified based on their recharge amounts, specifically users in the top 30% of recharge amounts in the first two months.

Predicting churn for these users allows telecom companies to implement targeted strategies, such as personalized retention offers or service improvements, to minimize revenue loss.

Business Goal and Data Overview
The dataset spans four months (June to September) and consists of customer-level records. The objective is to predict churn in September (month 9) using data from June to August (months 6, 7, and 8).

Customer behavior is segmented into three phases:

Stable Phase (Months 6 & 7): Normal usage behavior.
Action Phase (Month 8): Signs of dissatisfaction or reduced usage emerge.
Churn Phase (Month 9): The point where churn occurs (this data is only used for labeling, not for model training).
The dataset includes various telecom-related metrics, such as:

Call Usage: Outgoing and incoming call minutes across different networks.
Data Usage: Volume of 2G/3G data consumed.
Recharge Behavior: Amount and frequency of recharges.
Data Preparation Steps
Feature Engineering: Creating new variables that capture behavioral patterns predictive of churn.
Filtering High-Value Customers: Identifying users who meet the recharge-based threshold.
Labeling Churners: Customers who made no calls and had zero data usage in September are marked as churners (churn = 1, otherwise 0).
Dropping Churn Phase Data: Excluding all features related to September to ensure unbiased predictions.
Model Development
The goal is to build a predictive model that serves two purposes:

Churn Prediction: Identifying users likely to churn in the near future.
Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding key factors influencing churn.
To achieve this, the following steps are taken:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting variables, and standardizing data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends, correlations, and insights.
Dimensionality Reduction: Using PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to manage high-dimensional data.
Model Selection & Training: Evaluating multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
Class Imbalance Handling: Implementing techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to address the low churn rate (5-10%).
Model Evaluation: Choosing the best model based on precision, recall, F1-score, and other relevant metrics.
Since PCA reduces interpretability, an alternative logistic regression or tree-based model is used to identify the most significant predictors of churn.

Key Deliverables
Churn Prediction Model: A trained machine learning model capable of predicting high-risk customers.
Feature Analysis: A list of top features contributing to churn, presented through visualizations.
Business Recommendations: Actionable strategies based on insights, such as targeted customer engagement, service quality improvements, and personalized offers to retain high-value users.
This end-to-end solution will enable telecom companies to anticipate churn and take proactive measures, ultimately improving customer retention and maximizing revenue.
